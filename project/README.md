### CSE408 Final Project
### Sound Based Smart Alarm

The goal of this project is to create a working, functional alarm system that is tripped through audio cues. The armed state of the alarm is controlled by whether a chosen device is on the local WiFi network or not. For example, if a phone is present, then the person who owns the phone is home and the alarm will disarm.

Our goal is to be able to detect the sounds of breaking glass, of a door opening, and footsteps, all of which indicate someone's presence while the alarm is armed.

The folder breakdown is as follows:
* src: The final code that will run on our Teensy 3.6 device to carry out the system functionalities.
* brd: The files for the PCB board that will be CNC milled for this Project.
* case: The 3D design files required to print the case in which we hope to mount the project.

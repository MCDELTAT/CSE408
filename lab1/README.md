### CSE408 Lab 1
### Anti-Theft System Part 1

The goal of this lab is to build a simple anti-theft device that will trigger an alarm via flashing LEDs if one of the two or more devices is stolen. The determining condition is a simple photoresistor. When the device input sinks below a certain threshold, the alarm will trigger as it is presumed to be hidden in someone's pocket or bag.

Note that for my code, you must build it for devices of nodeid 7&8 or change the values in line 66. This is done as a simple noise reduction step to ensure that other teams working on the same lab do not have effect on my logic or motes.
